Hey look at me I'm a threadTest!
It's so fun being a threadTest.
Sometimes my friends - who are other threadTests - and I talk about how much we love testing threads.
It's usually quite dull talk.
But its exciting if you know what you're talking about.
Which I don't
I mean look at me I'm a god damn txt file.
Such an amateur I am.
I hate txt files
Yet I am one!
Gah, the irony.
The worst.
